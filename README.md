#There is Pbix file called "beontech - test Issues Fixed". This is a second version of my test (I don't expect this to be evaluated). During the interview a strange behavior on the function datesytd wasn't reflection as expected.
#So I went back and made some changes on how i obtian the Date on my Fact tables to establish a relationship with de calendar dimension. 
#The original file i got the date from the "time_hour" column to obtain the date column.
#On this version I got the date from the columns year, month and day, so i have only observations from the 2013 year, and the behavior of the function datesytd worked properly.
